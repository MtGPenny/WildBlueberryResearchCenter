        <p> The Wild Blueberry Network Information Centre (WBNIC) project began in June 1997 to provide scientific and
            technical information about wild blueberry production and marketing for producers, agricultural
            professionals, researchers and students by publishing information in an on-line format.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The initiative was originally a combined effort of the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture, MacRae
            Library, Faculty of Agriculture Dalhousie University, Wild Blueberry Producersâ€™ Association, and Agriculture
            and Agri-Food Canada, Research Branch.

            After 2000 the NSAC continued to maintain the site, taking advantage of the resources of all provinces in
            the Atlantic region, the University of Maine and beyond. The site is also listed on the US AgNIC site as the
            repository of record for information on wild blueberries.

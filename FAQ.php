                                    Lowbush blueberry plants are available for purchase from several sources. Please
                                    refer to <a href=" http://umaine.edu/blueberries/factsheets/">http://umaine.edu/blueberries/factsheets/</a>
                                    These plants are usually quite young and small in size. Due to the growing and
                                    spreading habit of lowbush blueberries, it can take several years before these plants begin to fill
                                    in. Generally wild blueberry fields are developed from existing stands growing on
                                    abandoned farmland. These plants have already established an underground rhizome and root
                                    system that spreads fairly quickly once management begins. Mulching with a material such as
                                    sawdust will assist the process.

                                    The term wild and lowbush basically refer to the same plant. Traditionally the term
                                    lowbush was used by extension, researchers and educators. Wild was used by the trade and
                                    marketing sectors. Now, the term wild is being accepted and used by all sectors of the North American
                                    industry. These plants naturally occur in Eastern Canada and Maine, and are managed on a
                                    commercial basis. Some lowbush blueberries are planted for production and therefore the word wild
                                    would not be used. Cultivated blueberries and highbush refer to the same plant. These are a larger growing shrub
                                    than lowbush and produce a larger fruit. Cultivated bushes are planted in rows. Most
                                    of this fruit is sold fresh compared to wild blueberries which are mostly processed and sold
                                    frozen. These two products compete together on the wild market.

                                        The main reason lowbush blueberries are pruned is to increase yields and
                                        possibly stimulate runner growth. Blueberries do not produce flowers on the first years growth. On
                                        second year growth the maximum number of flowers are produced. On older growth (third, forth
                                        year etc.) there will still be flowers produced but in general the number of flowers will
                                        be less. In addition to maximizing yields,weed control is more effective if you prune the
                                        blueberries. In fact, some of the herbicides can only be used after the plants have pruned.

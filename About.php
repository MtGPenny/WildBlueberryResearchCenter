        <u><h4> WBNIC History </h4></u>
        <p>The Wild Blueberry Network Information Centre project began in June 1997 to provide scientific
            and technical
            information about wild blueberry production and marketing for producers, agricultural professionals,
            researchers and students by publishing information on the Internet through the World Wide Web.
            </br>
            </br>
            The initiative was originally a combined effort of the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture, MacRae
            Library, Faculty of Agriculture Dalhousie University, Wild Blueberry Producersâ€™ Association, and Agriculture
            and Agri-Food Canada, Research Branch. After 2000 the NSAC continued to maintain the site, taking advantage
            of the resources of all provinces in the Atlantic region, the University of Maine and beyond. The site is
            also listed on the US AgNIC site as the repository of record for information on wild blueberries.

            Atlantic

        <u><h4>WBNIC Site Usage </h4></u>
        <p> The WBNIC receives an average of 9700 requests per month (from 1997 to 2004) totalling more
            than 1,000,000 such request since the site went on line in June 1997. (as of Nov 2004). We are able to track
            how many pages are requested per month, per week and per hour (see figure above). Tuesdays and Wednesdays
            are the busiest days, with requests peaking in the middle of the afternoon but occurring 24 hours a day,
            365 days a year. While the majority of requests have come from North America including the .com, .net, .ca
            and .edu domains, there are requests from over 60 different counties around the world. The most requested
            pages include the history pages authored by Gordon Kinsman followed by the advice and fact sheet pages.
            The people who maintain the site seek to provide links to the best sources of information on wild
            blueberries and to serve as a point of contact for questions on wild blueberries. Some of the most important
            aspects of the site include:
